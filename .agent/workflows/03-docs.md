# 03-docs

This workflow ensures documentation is up to date.

1. Check for documentation updates

   > [!NOTE]
   > Review the `docs/` folder to ensure implementation details in `docs/` are in sync with the codebase changes.
   > If there are new features, add them to `docs/`.

2. Update README if necessary
   > [!NOTE]
   > If architectural changes occurred, update `README.md`.
